# Elevator Pitch
**QuestNest** is a mobile app that turns household chores into a fun, rewarding system for kids, and a stress reliever for caregivers. Designed for families with children of all ages, the app uses a progression system powered by experience points (XP): kids complete chores assigned by their guardians, earn XP, and level up to unlock custom rewards like game currency, special outings, or screen time. <br>
<br>
**QuestNest** helps children build responsibility and feel accomplished, while giving parents a much-needed break and peace of mind.

# Problem Description
Parents struggle to assign and follow up on chores effectively, especially in busy families. Traditional chore charts often fail to provide the necessary structure or engagement to promote consistency and accountability. <br>
<br>
Families need a positive and structured system to balance responsibilities and build better habits in an engaging way.

# Customer & End User
- **Customers**: Parents, guardians, and caregivers who are responsible for managing household routines and encouraging positive behaviour in children
<br>
- **End Users**: Families with children between the ages of 5 and 18. Both parents and children will use the application

# Solution Statement
**QuestNest** is a gamified mobile application that makes chore tracking engaging and fun through a reward management system. The goal is to transform routine household chores into a rewarding quest, teaching responsibility and healthy habits through positive reinforcement.
